## Welcome!                                                             

Here you'll find documentation and tutorials for the COSMOS Project, a system that is designed to primarily support the development and operations of one or more small spacecraft. For more information on the project itself, visit the <a href="{{ site.project_website }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project website</a>


## What Now?

{% include important.html content="Before doing anything, make sure to review the
[safety procedures](pages/safety-procedures.html) for working with the hardware." %}


If you are just getting started with COSMOS, you should definitely check out the _Getting Started_ set of tutorials over on the sidebar.
