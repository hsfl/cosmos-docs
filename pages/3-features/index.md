## 3.1 COSMOS Core
core is organized into libraries and programs. The libraries provide the building blocks for everything done in COSMOS while the programs provide a basic set of essential command line programs to deploy COSMOS in any platform (core does not include graphic user interfaces).
- **COSMOS Agents**: persistent command line programs that can run in any platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, etc.) and interact with other agents on the network. The Agents can also control the hardware such as the ground station radio, antennas, satellite radio, satellite attitude control hardware, etc.
- **COSMOS Devices**: core provides a set of device drivers and libraries to connect to typical hardware (e.g. serial library, I2C library, CPU information library, disk, etc.)
- **COSMOS Math**: the Math library has the different mathematical functions to handle vectors, matrices, quaternions, least squares fitting, etc.
- **COSMOS Physics**: the Physics library provides features such as orbital propagation, attitude propagation, etc.
- **COSMOS Support**: most of the COSMOS features are bundled here. The Support library provides the basic configuration for setting up a COSMOS program (configCosmos.h), Coordinate Conversions, COSMOS errors handling, time utilities, Sockets, string handling, etc.
