# COSMOS with PyCubed

"*The PyCubed is an open-source, radiation-tested CubeSat framework that cost-effectively integrates ADCS, TT&C, C&DH, and EPS into a single PC104-compatible module programmable entirely in Python*" - quote from the [REx Lab website](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/projects/pycubed.html). 
At HSFL we currently use the PyCubed for the Artemis, Hiapo and Ke Ao CubeSats. 
[To get started with the PyCubed go to this tutorial.](https://www.notion.so/Hands-On-Quick-Start-d220f0ec88eb41c08ee855ff4f46d737)
