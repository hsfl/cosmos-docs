## Getting Started Series
This manual is currently geared towards programmers but will later be expanded for regular users. If you feel that some information is not clear, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/hsfl/cosmos-docs/issues) so we can improve the information (or you add your contributions directly via a pull request).

## System Requirements
To simplify the installation process, use one of the following operating systems: Linux Ubuntu 18.04 (or newer), Win 10, MacOS 10.10 (or newer). The COSMOS code is tested on these frequently so if there is a bug it will quickly be fixed.

If you are using a different OS (example: Linux CentOS) and find problems when compiling the code, please let us know by email or submit an issue in our [core repository](https://github.com/hsfl/cosmos-core/issues) and we'll try to fix it as soon as possible. 

Next we provide a step by step guide to help you to get started with COSMOS (download, install, run). We recommend following these steps listed in order for a better experience.

The most straightforward way to start with COSMOS is to install it under Linux Ubuntu 18.04. If you're on a Windows 10 computer we recommend using [Windows Susbsytem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and install the Ubuntu 18.04 app. Alternatively install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then install [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop), but this approach requires a computer with enough resources (recommended RAM 16GB, Intel i7 or better).

### Get Started

* To get COSMOS core installed start here:
