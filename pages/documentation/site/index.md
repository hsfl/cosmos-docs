## Welcome!

Welcome, developers! In this secret (shhh) part of the website you'll find some documentation on how the
website works.

{% include tip.html content="You may want to bookmark this page so you can easily find it in the future" %}

## Overview

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. The site is hosted by GitHub Pages.
[Jekyll Documentation Theme 6.0](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html) is used for the
theme.

If you're just joining the project, visit the [Getting Started](getting-started.html) page for instructions on setup.
