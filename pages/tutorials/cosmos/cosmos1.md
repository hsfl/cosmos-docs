## Introduction
QtCreator is an IDE (integrated development environment) targeted at C/C++ developers, and is included in the [Artemis Development Environment]({{site.folder_docs_other}}/development-environment.html) by default.


## Create a New COSMOS Project

Open up the `~/cosmos/source/projects/` directory. This folder contains all COSMOS projects that you will write.

Duplicate the project folder `simpleagent_template` and rename it as you wish. In this tutorial, we will use the project name `my_project`.

Open up QtCreator and go to _File_ -> _Open File or Project..._, and open the file `~/cosmos/source/projects/my_project/CMakeLists.txt`. This file contains the project configuration.

{% include important.html content="If this is your first time working with the project or you have
recently updated your software, you may be met with a `Configure Project` page.
Just select the `ARM32` kit and deselect the `Desktop` kit, then click the `Configure Project` button." %}

The project `simpleagent_template` will appear in the navigation pane on the left side of the window (you can always rename the project by editing the `CMakeLists.txt` file). Expand the project (double click), then expand the target `my_agent` and open the source file `my_agent.cpp`.

You should now see the `my_agent.cpp` source code in the editor.
