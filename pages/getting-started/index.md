## Getting Started Series
This manual is mostly geared towards COSMOS developers and will later be expanded for regular users. If you feel that some information is not clear, feel free to add a note to this document so we can improve the information (or you add your contributions directly to this document).
## System Requirements
To simplify your life, use one of the following operating systems: Linux Ubuntu 18.04 (or newer), Win 10, MacOS 10.10 (or newer). The COSMOS code is tested on these frequently so if there is a bug it will quickly be fixed.

If you are using a different OS and find problems when compiling the code, please let us know by email or submit an issue in our [core repository](https://github.com/hsfl/cosmos-core) and we'll try to fix it as soon as possible. This is a step by step guide to help you to get started with COSMOS (download, install, use). We recommend following these steps listed for a better experience.

The most straightforward way to start with COSMOS is to install it under Linux Ubuntu 18.04. If you donâ€™t have a machine with Linux we recommend installing [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then install [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
