# Request table
requests:
  - name: "Check Connection"
    usage: "is_up"
    brief: Checks if the PyCubed can be reached.
    note: >
      If the PyCubed is connected properly, the request will return `"UP"`.
      Otherwise, the request will return `"DOWN"`.

  - name: "Send Message"
    usage: "send_message <message_str>"
    aliases: "send"
    brief: Sends a message to the PyCubed.
    note: >
      The argument `message_str` is a message formatted to the
      [PyCubed communication protocol](/pages/software/documentation/pycubed/communication-protocol.html) requirements.
      The leading `$` and checksum should not be included.

  - name: "Get IMU Data"
    usage: "imu"
    brief: Retrieves the PyCubed IMU data.
    note: >
      Returns a JSON-formatted string.

  - name: "Get GPS Data"
    usage: "gps"
    brief: Retrieves the PyCubed GPS data.
    note: >
      Returns a JSON-formatted string.

  - name: "Get Power Data"
    usage: "power"
    brief: Retrieves the PyCubed power data.
    note: >
      Returns a JSON-formatted string.

  - name: "Get Temperature Data"
    usage: "temperature"
    aliases: "temp"
    brief: Retrieves the PyCubed temperature data.
    note: >
      Returns a JSON-formatted string.

  - name: "Kill Radio"
    usage: "killradio yes"
    brief: Kills future radio transmission.
    note: |
      The argument `yes` is required, and is meant to prevent accidental usage of the request.

      > **_Note:_** **You should not call this request** unless the radio is transmitting harmful noise, or if you are performing tests.
