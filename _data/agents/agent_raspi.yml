# Requests
requests:
  - name: "Secure Shell Commanding"
    usage: "ssh <command>"
    aliases: "command"
    brief: Executes a command on the Raspberry Pi through a SSH connection.
    note: The argument `command` is a shell command to run on the Raspberry Pi.

  - name: "Check Connection"
    usage: "ping"
    aliases: "is_up"
    brief: Checks if the Raspberry Pi can be reached.
    note: |
      Internally this uses the Linux `ping` command to check if the Raspberry Pi is detected on the local network.

      If the Raspberry Pi can be reached, the request will return `"UP`". Otherwise, the request will return `"DOWN"`.

  - name: "Shut Down Raspberry Pi"
    usage: "shutdown_raspi"
    aliases: "end"
    brief: Attempts to shut down the Raspberry Pi
    note: |
      Internally this executes `sudo shutdown now` on the Raspberry Pi.

      > **_Note:_** the request name `shutdown` is not used, as this is reserved by COSMOS for a different purpose.

  - name: "Get Agent Data"
    usage: "get_data"
    aliases: "agent_data"
    brief: Returns agent information as a JSON-formatted string.
    note: This request is primarily used by the Artemis CubeSat Library on the Raspberry Pi to fetch data.
