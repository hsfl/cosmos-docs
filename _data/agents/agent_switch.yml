    usage: "switch <name> [on | off]"
    aliases: ["state", "set", "get"]
    brief: Enables, disables, or displays information for a given switch.
    note: |
      The first argument corresponds to the [name of the switch](#pin-mapping)

      The second argument is optional:
      * If `on` is given, the agent will turn on the given switch.
      * If `off` is given, the agent will turn off the given switch.

      If the second argument is not supplied, the status of the switch will be returned.
