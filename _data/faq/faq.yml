  # ================== COSMOS ==================
  - name: "COSMOS"
    content:

      - question: "Some of my SimpleAgent device properties aren't showing up externally, what's happening?"
        answer: >
          Unfortunately there is currently a bug in COSMOS which prevents certain properties from being posted.
          There's no good way to figure out which ones are broken other than to dig through the COSMOS source
          code. For now you can try using a different property to store your values. Hopefully this issue gets 
          fixed soon!

      - question: "None of the properties for _one_ of my SimpleAgent devices are showing up externally. What gives?"
        answer: >
          This seems to be a bug in COSMOS, but it's difficult to replicate. For now you can try switching the 
          order you create your devices. If you have only a single device, you can add another device beforehand 
          which goes unused.

  # ================== Raspberry Pi ==================
  - name: "Raspberry Pi"
    content:

      - question: "After powering my Raspberry Pi I can no longer access it from the BeagleBone"
        answer: >
          Disconnecting power to the Raspberry Pi without shutting it down beforehand can cause the micro SD card 
          containing the operating system to become corrupted. Unfortunately you probably won't be able to recover 
          any data from the card. If you can't even connect to the Raspberry Pi from a desktop machine or laptop, 
          you should try flashing its micro SD card with a fresh image.

      - question: "Why does the Artemis CubeSat Library take so long to update and copy files?"
        answer: >
          This is an issue caused by the time it takes to establish a SSH connection between the BeagleBone and
          Raspberry Pi. To fix this, you can try disabling DNS in the SSH configuration for both the BeagleBone 
          and Raspberry Pi.


  # ================== BeagleBone ==================
  - name: "BeagleBone"
    content:

      - question: "Why are the power lines on my BeagleBone measuring at strange voltages?"
        answer: >
          Uh oh, that could be bad. Sometimes connecting or disconnecting peripherals while the BeagleBone is 
          powered can damage the internal power lines (we've done this ourselves, unfortunately). If you can't 
          get correct voltages after a while, it could be that your BeagleBone is fried, and you'll need to 
          find a new one.

  # ================== VirtualBox ==================
  - name: "VirtualBox"
    content:

      - question: "Why am I getting an error before the virtual machine ever boots?"
        answer: >
          It could be because you need to enable hardware virtualization on your motherboard. For most motherboards
          you'll probably be able to find a guide for this.

      - question: "Why can't I auto-resize my virtual machine display?"
        answer: >
          You'll need to install <a href="tutorials/setup/setup2.html#install-guest-additions">VirtualBox Guest Additions</a>
          on your guest machine.

      - question: "Why does my virtual machine randomly crash?"
        answer: >
          It might be a problem with hardware acceleration using your GPU. In the settings for the virtual machine
          you can go to the Display tab and change the graphics controller setting, or disable hardware acceleration.
